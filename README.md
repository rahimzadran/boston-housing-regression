# Linear Regression Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a step-by-step implementation of linear regression using Python. It covers essential concepts such as data preprocessing, feature scaling, feature engineering, linear regression modeling, gradient descent, and the concept of the best-fit line. The project also evaluates model performance using metrics like R-squared and t-statistics.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **code/**: Includes Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and implementation of gradient descent.
